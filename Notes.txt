Step 1 :

-- open console and create bucket 

--  enable  bucket versioning 

-- encryption also u should enable 

Step 2 :

-- Create IAM Role for the API Gateway 

-- IAM --> create Role --> trusted type = AWS --> Use case = API Gateway --> create Role with ( any Name)

-- Now create Policy for the IAM Role 

--  Policies --> create New Policy --> choose Service = s3 --> Allowed Actions = select all Actions--> Resourece = Add Arn of ur bucket and check for object Name (any)--> nxt --> give name for ur policy --> create policy 

-- Now attach this policy to the Role that u have created just now 


Step 3 

-- Create Api Gateway 

--  open Api Gateway console 

-- select REST API --> give name for ur API -- create API 

-- now we have create some Resoureces 

-- click on create Resourece --> give Resourece name as {bucket}

-- create another Resourece --> give resource name as {filename}

-- now create Method --> Method type = PUT --> choose AWS Service as Integration type (we are directly giving S3 bucket here, coz getting error with the lambda Integration  with post method do I have  tried this ) --> choose Region(same as s3 bucket Region) --> Aws Service = S3 --> Aws Subdomain (blank)--> HTTP Method = PUT --> Action Type = Use Path Override --> path Override = {bucket}/{filename} --> Execution Role = Role Arn --> create Method

-- Now Click on Integrate Request --> edit --> URL path parameters = C.O Add path Parameter , now add 2 parameter ( name = bucket , mapped From = method.request.path.bucket) , (name = filename , mapped From = method.request.path.filename) --> save 

-- Now go to Api Setting --> Binary media types --> add Media types as image/jpeg , image/png , */* --> save changes 

NOte : if u put */* , u can able to upload Pdf files 

-- ebable CORS in API , before going to deploy for not geting any errors in future 

-- now u have to Deploy ur API -- > U will get invoke Url (better to  wait for 5 min to deploy ur API )

--  now open API Postman , if u do not have do downalod or do test in chrome 

-- now copy the invoke Url --> select PUT Method --> give resource we have created in API /bucket/filename  after url 

Eg : https://1loe0bz5i8.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/bucketname/filename 


-- create 3 sample files for testing purpose in ur local system 

1 sample.txt

2 sample2.png

3 sample3.jpeg

-- now paste the link in the postnman and test ur API with the sample files whether it is store in the s3 bucket or not 

Note : The file is only <= 10MB Only 

-- Now do test 

-- open posyman APi for testing 

-- copy and pate url and select PUT 

eg : https://1loe0bz5i8.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api-bucket-upload/sample.txt 

for above test example --> 

Note : what i have observed is that if i have uploaded all the files (pdf,html,jpeg,png) with sample.txt format but when i check in the bucket it has uploaded all the files 

-- u can also do test for .jpeg and .png also
